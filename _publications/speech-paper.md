permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'We propose the application of a semi-supervised learning
method to improve the performance of acoustic modelling for
automatic speech recognition with limited linguistically annotated material. Our method combines sparse autoencoders
with feed-forward networks, thus taking advantage of both unlabelled and labelled data simultaneously through mini-batch
stochastic gradient descent. We tested the method with varying proportions of labelled vs unlabelled observations in frame based phoneme classification on the TIMIT database. Our experiments show that the method outperforms standard supervised models of similar complexity for an equal amount of
labelled data and provides competitive error rates compared
to state-of-the-art graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques'
